cgccpp is a C++ library for reading and writing CGC information.  This
was written to support gold, the CGC linker, and may not be generally
useful.

cgccpp does not do file I/O.  It deals only with offsets and memory
data.

For efficiency, most accessors are templates with two arguments: the
CGC file class (32 or 64 bits) and the endianness.
